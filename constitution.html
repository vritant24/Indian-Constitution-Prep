<5>of the Legislative Assembly of such State thereon shall be final.</>
<6>4.</><5>   There shall be endorsed on every Money Bill when it is transmitted to the</>
<5>Legislative Council under article 198, and when it is presented to the Governor</>

<7>200. Assent to Bills</>
<5>When a Bill has been passed by the Legislative Assembly of a State or, in the case of a</>
<5>State having a Legislative Council, has been passed by both Houses of the Legislature</>

<5>the Governor for assent, the Governor shall not withhold assent therefrom:</>
<5>Provided further that the Governor shall not assent to, but shall reserve for the</>
<5>consideration of the President, any Bill which in the opinion of the Governor would,</>
<5>if it became law, so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger the</>
<5>position which that Court is by this Constitution designed to fill.</>
<7>201. Bills reserved for consideration</>
<5>When a Bill is reserved by a Governor for the consideration of the President, the</>
<5>President shall declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent</>
